Welcome to [M0Nk3y WebDev](https://github.com/toddmath), featuring tutorials and tricks I picked up on my journey towards full stack awesomeness!! Honestly, the reason why I created this blog was for the development experiance. Also, call me a :neckbeard: but I enjoy challenging myself to improve my development skills. After putting a little thought into what kind of content it'd consist of, I realized I had an opportunity to write about things I'm learning. Not only will that help solidify fresh knowledge I gain, more importantly, I might be able to pass some of it on. Well, enough rambling about this stupid blog.

My name is Todd Matheson. I'm a 43 year old aspiring front-end / full-stack web developer from the Bay Area, California. I always loved messing around with computers and seeing how much I could instruct them to do what I whatever. I worked as a Carpenter for a little over a decade, but felt like something was missing. After contemplating on my past, present and future, I decided to drop everything and go full force towards a completely new direction, a direction I love. Whoever said, _"do what you love and you'll never have to work a day in your life."_ is a genius and I'm basing my future happiness on that simple statement. I Hope you enjoy my site and learn something new.
